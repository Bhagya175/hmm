                <p>
                A solar or Planetary system consist of a star around which planets revolve.In our solar system,the central star is the sun.
                Nine planets move around it at different distances.Some of these planets have moons that revolve around them.
                Our solar system also includes some other smaller heavenly bodies such as asteroids and comets.The sun transmits energy
                to the planets by its heat and light.Without the sun,no wind will blow and the earth will grow ice-cold.During the 
                few minutes of a solar eclipse,one can easily feel the sharp drop in temperature.

        <h3>What are planets?</h3>
        Planets are large spherical heavenly bodies,which move in an orbit around a central star(sun).
        Unlike the sun they do not produce any energy of their own.There are nine planets in our solar system. 
        The planets near the sun(the 'inner planets')are Mercury,Venus,Earth,and Mars.The planets away from the sun(the
        'outer'planets)are Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune,and Pluto.For long,scientists were not sure
        whether pluto is actually a planet or just an asteroid.Now,pluto is regarded as a 'dwarf planet' . 
        We can easily remember the sequence of the nine planets with a small saying:"<strong>M</strong>y <strong>V</strong>ery 
        <strong>E</strong>ducated <strong>M</strong>other <strong>J</strong>ust <strong>S</strong>erved <strong>U</strong>s <strong>N</strong>ine <strong>P</strong>izzas".

                <p>
                Scientists assume that there are other planetary systems,but find it difficult to locate
                them because most stars are very far away.Even the nearest star is more than 4light years(around 40,000 billion kilometers)
                away from us.Moreover,the light of a star is so strong that it completely 'outshines' the 
                weak light of the surrounding planets.Trying to find a planetary system is like travelling
                away from the sun and no longer being able to see the road.For this reason,the remote planets
                cannot be seen even with the strongest telescopes.Astronomers can,however,measure the movements
                of stars and infer whether they are influenced by other heavenly bodies.

                    <h3>Why Does Sun Shine?</h3>
                    <p>
                         To a large extent,the sun is made up of hydrogen,which is converted into the element
                        helium inside the sun's atmosphere.In the resultant fusion of two hyadrogen atoms with helium
                        ,alot of energy is released.As a result,the core of the sun heats up to an unimaginable
                        temperature:about 8 million C!On the surface of the sun,the temperature is <stong>only</stong> around
                        5500 C.The sun releases this heat energy in the form of radiation,which gives it its fiery glow.about every 11 years,
                        the surface of the sun changes and what we knows as <strong>sunspots</strong> occur.The surface
                        is somewhat cooler and darker around the spots.Thus,they radiate less energy.A few reserchers
                        believe that an increase in the occurence of these spots causes ice ages on the Earth.

                        <h3>How does a solar eclipse take place?</h3>
                        <p>
                        A solar eclipse takes place at new moon,and the Earth fall in a straight line and the 
                        moon covers the Earth.The shadow of the moon,about 270km in diameter,falls on the Earth.
                        In this so-called umbra shadow,a broad strip on the surface of the Earth becomes dark for
                        a few minutes and marks the completion of a 'total solar eclipse'.The pneumbra of the moon
                        is somewhat bigger-about 3000km in diameter.In this area,the moon does not cover the sun completely. 
                        But we can observe how slowly the moon moves between the sun and the Earth.

                        The Greek word 'planet' means 'wanderer'?The name indicates that contrary to the 
                        stars,the planets 'wander' across the sky.

                        During a solar eclipse,the shadow of the moon is not smoothly demarcated,but slightly
                        jagged?This happens because of the mountains and craters on the moon.The sun 'flashes'
                        through some of the craters of the moon and forms a ring,resembling a pearl necklace,in the sky.
